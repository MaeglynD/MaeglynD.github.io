      “Relative State” Formulation of Quantum
Mechanics∗
Hugh Everett, III†
Palmer Physical Laboratory, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey
1. Introduction
The task of quantizing general relativity raises serious questions about the
meaning of the present formulation and interpretation of quantum mechanics
when applied to so fundamental a structure as the space-time geometry itself.
This paper seeks to clarify the foundations of quantum mechanics. It presents
a reformulation of quantum theory in a form believed suitable for application
to general relativity.
The aim is not to deny or contradict the conventional formulation of
quantum theory, which has demonstrated its usefulness in an overwhelming
variety of problems, but rather to supply a new, more general and complete
formulation, from which the conventional interpretation can be deduced.
The relationship of this new formulation to the older formulation is therefore that of a metatheory to a theory, that is, it is an underlying theory in
which the nature and consistency, as well as the realm of applicability, of the
older theory can be investigated and clarified.

The new theory is not based on any radical departure from the conventional one. The special postulates in the old theory which deal with observation are omitted in the new theory. The altered theory thereby acquires a
new character. It has to be analyzed in and for itself before any identification
becomes possible between the quantities of the theory and the properties of
the world of experience. The identification, when made, leads back to the
omitted postulates of the conventional theory that deal with observation, but
in a manner which clarifies their role and logical position.
We begin with a brief discussion of the conventional formulation, and
some of the reasons which motivate one to seek a modification.
2. Realm of Applicability of the Conventional
or “External Observation” Formulation of
Quantum Mechanics
We take the conventional or “external observation” formulation of quantum
mechanics to be essentially the following1
: A physical system is completely
described by a state function ψ, which is an element of a Hilbert space,
and which furthermore gives information only to the extent of specifying the
probabilities of the results of various observations which can be made on the
system by external observers. There are two fundamentally different ways in
which the state function can change:
Process 1 : The discontinuous change brought about by the observation
of a quantity with eigenstates φ1, φ2, · · · , in which the state ψ will be
changed to the state φj with probability |(ψ, φj )|
2
.
Process 2 : The continuous, deterministic change of state of an isolated
system with time according to a wave equation ∂ψ/∂t = Aψ, where A
is a linear operator.
This formulation describes a wealth of experience. No experimental evidence
is known which contradicts it.
1We use the terminology and notation of J. von Neumann, Mathematical Foundations of
Quantum Mechnanics, translated by R. T. Beyer (Princeton University Press, Princeton,
1955).
2
Not all conceivable situations fit the framework of this mathematical formulation. Consider for example an isolated system consisting of an observer
or measuring apparatus, plus an object system. Can the change with time of
the state of the total system be described by Process 2? If so, then it would
appear that no discontinuous probabilistic process like Process 1 can take
place. If not, we are forced to admit that systems which contain observers
are not subject to the same kind of quantum-mechanical description as we
admit for all other physical systems. The question cannot be ruled out as
lying in the domain of psychology. Much of the discussion of “observers” in
quantum mechanics has to do with photoelectric cells, photographic plates,
and similar devices where a mechanistic attitude can hardly be contested. For
the following one can limit himself to this class of problems, if he is unwilling
to consider observers in the more familiar sense on the same mechanistic level
of analysis.
What mixture of Process 1 and 2 of the conventional formulation is to be
applied to the case where only an approximate measure is effected; that is,
where an apparatus or observer interacts only weakly and for a limited time
with an object system? In this case of an approximate measurement a proper
theory must specify (1) the new state of the object system that corresponds
to any particular reading of the apparatus and (2) the probability with which
this reading will occur. von Neumann showed how to treat a special class of
approximate measurements by the method of projection operators.2 However, a general treatment of all approximate measurements by the method of
projections operators can be shown (Sec. 4) to be impossible.
How is one to apply the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics
to the space-time geometry itself? The issue becomes especially acute in the
case of a closed universe.3 There is no place to stand outside the system
to observe it. There is nothing outside it to produce transitions from one
state to another. Even the familiar concept of a proper state of the energy
is completely inapplicable. In the derivation of the law of conservation of
energy, one defines the total energy by way of an integral extended over a
surface large enough to include all parts of the system and their interactions.4
But in a closed space, when a surface is made to include more and more of

the volume, it ultimately disappears into nothingness. Attempts to define
the total energy for a closed space collapse to the vacuous statement, zero
equals zero.
How are a quantum description of a closed universe, of approximate measurements, and of a system that contains an observer to be made? These
three questions have one feature in common, that they all inquire about the
quantum mechanics that is internal to an isolated system.
No way is evident to apply the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics to a system that is not subject to external observation. The whole
interpretive scheme of that formalism rests upon the notion of external observation. The probabilities of the various possible outcomes of the observation
are prescribed exclusively by Process 1. Without that part of the formalism
there is no means whatever to ascribe a physical interpretation to the conventional machinery. But Process 1 is out of the question for systems not
subject to external observation.5
3. Quantum Mechanics Internal to an Isolated System
This paper proposes to regard pure wave mechanics (Process 2 only) as a
complete theory. It postulates that a wave function that obeys a linear wave
equation everywhere and at all times supplies a complete mathematical model
for every isolated physical system without exception. It further postulates
that every system that is subject to external observation can be regarded as
part of a larger isolated system.
The wave function is taken as the basic physical entity with no a priori
interpretation. Interpretation only comes after an investigation of the logical
structure of the theory. Here as always the theory itself sets the framework
for its interpretation.5
For any interpretation it is necessary to put the mathematical model
of the theory into correspondence with experience. For this purpose it is
necessary to formulate abstract models for observers that can be treated
within the theory itself as physical systems, to consider isolated systems
containing such model observers in interaction with other subsystems, to
5See in particular the discussion of this point by N. Bohr and L. Rosenfeld, Kgl. Danske

deduce the changes that occur in an observer as a consequence of interaction
with the surrounding subsystems, and to interpret the changes in the familiar
language of experience.
Section 4 investigates representations of the state of a composite system
in terms of states of constituent subsystems. The mathematics leads one
to recognize the concept of the relativity of states, in the following sense: a
constituent subsystem cannot be said to be in any single well-defined state,
independently of the remainder of the composite system. To any arbitrarily chosen state for one subsystem there will correspond a unique relative
state for the remainder of the composite system. This relative state will
usually depend upon the choice of state for the first subsystem. Thus the
state of one subsystem does not have an independent existence, but is fixed
only by the state of the remaining subsystem. In other words, the states
occupied by the subsystems are not independent, but correlated. Such correlations between systems arise whenever systems interact. In the present
formulation all measurements and observation processes are to be regarded
simply as interactions between the physical systems involved—interactions
which produce strong correlations. A simple model for a measurement, due
to von Neumann, is analyzed from this viewpoint.
Section 5 gives an abstract treatment of the problem of observation. This
uses only the superposition principle, and general rules by which composite
system states are formed of subsystem states, in order that the results shall
have the greatest generality and be applicable to any form of quantum theory
for which these principles hold. Deductions are drawn about the state of
the observer relative to the state of the object system. It is found that
experiences of the observer (magnetic tape memory, counter system, etc.)
are in full accord with predictions of the conventional “external observer”
formulation of quantum mechanics, based on Process 1.
Section 6 recapitulates the “relative state” formulation of quantum mechanics.
4. Concept of Relative State
We now investigate some consequences of the wave mechanical formalism of
composite systems. If a composite system S, is composed of two subsystems
S1 and S2, with associated Hilbert spaces H1 and H2, then, according to
the usual formalism of composite systems, the Hilbert space for S is taken
5
to be the tensor product of H1 and H2 (written H = H1 ⊗ H2). This has
the consequence that if the sets {ξ
S1
i
} and {η
S2
j
} are complete orthonormal
sets of states for S1 and S2, respectively, then the general state of S can be
written as a superposition:
ψ
S =
X
i,j
aij ξ
S1
i
η
S2
j
. (1)
From (3.1) [sic] although S is in a definite state ψ
S
, the subsystems S1 and
S2 do not possess anything like definite states independently of one another
(except in the special case where all but one of the aij are zero).
We can, however, for any choice of a state in one subsystem, uniquely
assign a corresponding relative state in the other subsystem. For example,
if we choose ξk as the state for S1, while the composite system S is in the
state ψ
S given by (3.1) [sic], then the corresponding relative state in S2,
ψ(S2; relξk, S1), will be:
ψ(S2; relξk, S1) = Nk
X
j
akjη
S2
j
(2)
where Nk is a normalization constant. This relative state for ξk is independent
of the choice of basis {ξi} (i 6= k) for the orthogonal complement of ξk, and is
hence determined uniquely by ξk alone. To find the relative state in S2 for an
arbitrary state of S1 therefore, one simply carries out the above procedure
using any pair of bases for S1 and S2 which contains the desired state as
one element of the basis for S1. To find states in S1 relative to states in S2,
interchange S1 and S2 in the procedure.
In the conventional or “external observation” formulation, the relative
state in S2, ψ(S2; relφ, S1), for a state φ
S1
in S1, gives the conditional probability distributions for the results of all measurements in S2, given that S1
has been measured and found to be in state φ
S1—i.e., that φ
S1
is the eigenfunction of the measurement in S1 corresponding to the observed eigenvalue.
For any choice of basis in S1, {ξi}, it is always possible to represent the
state of S, (1), as a single superposition of pairs of states, each consisting of
a state from the basis {ξi} in S1 and its relative state in S2. Thus, from (2),
(1) can be written in the form:
ψ
S =
X
i
1
Ni
ξ
S1
i ψ(S2; relξi
, S1). (3)
6
This is an important representation used frequently.
Summarizing: There does not, in general, exist anything like a single
state for one subsystem of a composite system. Subsystems do not possess
states that are independent of the states of the remainder of the system, so
that the subsystem states are generally correlated with one another. One can
arbitrarily choose a state for one subsystem, and be led to the relative state
for the remainder. Thus we are faced with a fundamental relativity of states,
which is implied by the formalism of composite systems. It is meaningless to
ask the absolute state of a subsystem—one can only ask the state relative to
a given state of the remainder of the subsystem
At this point we consider a simple example, due to von Neumann, which
serves as a model of a measurement process. Discussion of this example prepares the ground for the analysis of “observation.” We start with a system
of only one coordinate, q (such as position of a particle), and an apparatus
of one coordinate r (for example the position of a meter needle). Further
suppose that they are initially independent, so that the combined wave function is ψ
S+A
0 = φ(q)η(r) where φ(q) is the initial system wave function, and
η(r) is the initial apparatus function. The Hamiltonian is such that the two
systems do not interact except during the interval t = 0 to t = T, during
which time the total Hamiltonian consists only of a simple interaction,
HI = −ihq¯ (∂/∂r). (4)
Then the state
ψ
S+A
t
(q, r) = φ(q)η(r − qt) (5)
is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation,
ih¯(∂ψS+A
t
/∂t) = HIψ
S+A
t
, (6)
for the specified initial conditions at time t = 0.
From (5) at time t = T (at which time interaction stops) there is no longer
any definite independent apparatus state, nor any independent system state.
The apparatus therefore does not indicate any definite object-system value,
and nothing like process 1 has occurred.
Nevertheless, we can look upon the total wave function (5) as a superposition of pairs of subsystem states, each element of which has a definite q value
and a correspondingly displaced apparatus state. Thus after the interaction
the state (5) has the form:
ψ
S+A
T =
Z
φ(q
0
)δ(q − q
0
)η(r − qT)dq0
, (7)
7
which is a superposition of states ψq
0 = δ(q − q
0
)η(r − qT). Each of these
elements, ψq
0, of the superposition describes a state in which the system has
the definite value q = q
0
, and in which the apparatus has a state that is
displaced from its original state by the amount q
0T. These elements ψq
0 are
then superposed with coefficients φ(q
0
) to form the total state (7).
Conversely, if we transform to the representation where the apparatus
coordinate is definite, we write (5) as
ψ
S+A
T =
Z
(1/Nr
0)ξ
r
0
(q)δ(r − r

)dr0
,
where

(1/Nr

(q)φ(q)η

(r
0 − qT)η(r
0 − qT)dq.
Then the ξ
r
0
(q) are the relative system state functions6
for the apparatus
states δ(r − r
0
) of definite value r = r
0
.
If T is sufficiently large, or η(r) sufficiently sharp (near δ(r)), then ξ
r
0
(q) is
nearly δ(q −r
0/T) and the relative system states ξ
r
0
(q) are nearly eigenstates
for the values q = r
0/T.
We have seen that (8) is a superposition of states ψr
0, for each of which the
apparatus has recorded a definite value r
0
, and the system is left in approximately the eigenstate of the measurement corresponding to q = r
0/T. The
discontinuous “jump” into an eigenstate is thus only a relative proposition,
dependent upon the mode of decomposition of the total wave function into
the superposition, and relative to a particularly chosen apparatus-coordinate
value. So far as the complete theory is concerned all elements of the superposition exist simultaneously, and the entire process is quite continuous.
von Neumann’s example is only a special case of a more general situation.
Consider any measuring apparatus interacting with any object system. As
6This example provides a model of an approximate measurement. However, the relative
system states after the interaction ξ
r
0
(q) cannot ordinarily be generated from the original
system state φ by the application of any projection operator, E. Proof: Suppose on
the contrary that ξ
r
0
(q) = NEφ(q) = N0φ(q)η(r
0 − qt), where N, N0 are normalization
constants. Then
E(NEφ(q)) = NE2φ(q) = N
00φ(q)η
2
(r
0 − qt)
and E2φ(q) = (N00/N)φ(q)η
2
(r
0 − qt). But the condition E2 = E which is necessary for
E to be a projection implies that N0/N00η(q) = η
2
(q) which is generally false.

a result of the interaction the state of the measuring apparatus is no longer
capable of independent definition. It can be defined only relative to the state
of the object system. In other words, there exists only a correlation between
the two states of the two systems. It seems as if nothing can ever be settled
by such a measurement.
This indefinite behavior seems to be quite at variance with our observations, since physical objects always appear to us to have definite positions.
Can we reconcile this feature wave mechanical theory built purely on Process
2 with experience, or must the theory be abandoned as untenable? In order
to answer this question we consider the problem of observation itself within
the framework of the theory.
5. Observation
We have the task of making deductions about the appearance of phenomena
to observers which are considered as purely physical systems and are treated
within the theory. To accomplish this it is necessary to identify some present
properties of such an observer with features of the past experience of the
observer. Thus, in order to say that an observer 0 has observed the event α,
it is necessary that the state of 0 has become changed from its former state
to a new state which is dependent upon α.
It will suffice for our purposes to consider the observers to possess memories (i.e., parts of a relatively permanent nature whose states are in correspondence with past experience of the observers). In order to make deductions
about the past experience of an observer it is sufficient to deduce the present
contents of the memory as it appears within the mathematical model.
As models for observers we can, if we wish, consider automatically functioning machines, possessing sensory apparatus and coupled to recording
devices capable of registering past sensory data and machine configurations.
We can further suppose that the machine is so constructed that its present
actions shall be determined not only by its present sensory data, but by
the contents of its memory as well. Such a machine will then be capable
of performing a sequence of observations (measurements), and furthermore
of deciding upon its future experiments on the basis of past results. If we
consider that current sensory data, as well as machine configuration, is immediately recorded in the memory, then the actions of the machine at a given
instant can be regarded as a function of the memory contents only, and all
9
relavant [sic] experience of the machine is contained in the memory.
For such machines we are justified in using such phrases as “the machine
has perceived A” or “the machine is aware of A” if the occurrence of A is
represented in the memory, since the future behavior of the machine will
be based upon the occurrence of A. In fact, all of the customary language
of subjective experience is quite applicable to such machines, and forms the
most natural and useful mode of expression when dealing with their behavior,
as is well known to individuals who work with complex automata.
When dealing with a system representing an observer quantum mechanically we ascribe a state function, ψ
0
, to it. When the state ψ
0 describes an
observer whose memory contains representations of the events A, B, · · · , C
we denote this fact by appending the memory sequence in brackets as a
subscript, writing:
ψ
0
[A,B,··· ,C]
. (9)
The symbols A, B, · · · , C, which we assume to be ordered time-wise, therefore stand for memory configurations which are in correspondence with the
past experience of the observer. These configurations can be regarded as
punches in a paper tape, impressions on a magnetic reel, configurations of a
relay switching circuit, or even configurations of brain cells. We require only
that they be capable of the interpretation “The observer has experienced
the succession of events A, B, · · · , C.” (We sometimes write dots in a memory sequence, · · · A, B, · · · , C, to indicate the possible presence of previous
memories which are irrelevant to the case being considered.)
The mathematical model seeks to treat the interaction of such observer
systems with other physical systems (observations), within the framework of
Process 2 wave mechanics, and to deduce the resulting memory configurations, which are then to be interpreted as records of the past experiences of
the observers.
We begin by defining what constitutes a “good” observation. A good
observation of a quantity A, with eigenfunctions φi
, for a system S, by an
observer whose initial states is ψ
0
, consists of an interaction which, in a
specified period of time, transforms each (total) state
ψ
S+0 = φiψ
0
[...]
(10)
into a new state
ψ
S+00
= φiψ
0
[...αi]
(11)
10
where αi characterizes7
the state φi
. (The symbol, αi
, might stand for a
recording of the eigenvalue, for example.) That is, we require that the system
state, if it is an eigenstate, shall be unchanged, and (2) that the observer
state shall change so as to describe an observer that is “aware” of which
eigenfunction it is; that is, some property is recorded in the memory of the
observer which characterizes φi
, such as the eigenvalue. The requirement that
the eigenstates for the system be unchanged is necessary if the observation
is to be significant (repeatable), and the requirement that the observer state
change in a manner which is different for each eigenfunction is necessary if
we are to be able to call the interaction an observation at all. How closely a
general interaction satisfies the definition of a good observation depends upon
(1) the way in which the interaction depends upon the dynamical variables of
the observer system—including memory variables—and upon the dynamical
variables of the object system and (2) the initial state of the observer system.
Given (1) and (2), one can for example solve the wave equation, deduce the
state of the composite system after the end of the interaction, and check
whether an object system that was originally in an eigenstate is left in an
eigenstate, as demanded by the repeatability postulate. This postulate is
satisfied, for example, by the model of von Neumann that has already been
discussed.
From the definition of a good observation we first deduce the result of an
observation upon a system which is not in an eigenstate of the observation.
We know from our definition that the interaction transforms states φiψ
0
[··· ]
into states φiψ
0
[···αi]
. Consequently these solutions of the wave equation can
be superposed to give the final state for the case of an arbitrary initial system
state. Thus if the initial system state is not an eigenstate, but a general state
P
i
aiφi
, the final total state will have the form:
ψ
S+00
=
Xaiφiψ
0
[···αi]
. (12)
This superposition principle continues to apply in the presence of further
systems which do not interact during the measurement. Thus, if systems
S1, S2, · · · , Sn are present as well as 0, with original states ψ
S1
, ψS2
, · · · , ψSn ,
and the only interaction during the time of measurement takes place between
7
It should be understood that ψ
0
[...αi]
is a different state for each i. A more precise
notation would write ψ
0
i[...αi]
, but no confusion can arise if we simply let the ψ
0
i be indexed
only by the index of the memory configuration symbol.
11
S1 and 0, the measurement will transform the initial total state:
ψ
S1+S2+···+Sn+0 = ψ
S1ψ

[··· ]
(13)
into the final state:

X

aiφ
S1
i ψ
S2
· · · ψ
Sn ψ
0
[···αi]
(14)
where ai = (φ
S1
i
, ψS1 ) and φ
S1
i
are the eigenfunctions of the observation.
Thus we arrive at the general rule for the transformation of total state
functions which describe systems within which observation processes occur:
Rule 1 : The observation of a quantity A, with eigenfunctions φ
S1
i
, in a
system S1 by the observer 0, transforms the total state according to:
ψ
S1ψ
S2

Sn ψ

i ψ

· · · ψ

[···αi]
(15)
where
ai = (φ
S1
i
, ψS1
).
If we next consider a second observation to be made, where our total
state is now a superposition, we can apply Rule 1 separately to each element
of the superposition, since each element separately obeys the wave equation
and behaves independently of the remaining elements, and then superpose
the results to obtain the final solution. We formulate this as:
Rule 2 : Rule 1 may be applied separately to each element of a superposition of total system states, the results being superposed to obtain
the final total state. Thus, a determination of B, with eigenfunctions
η

j
, on S2 by the observer 0 transforms the total state

to each element φ

, and then superposing the results
with the coefficients ai
.
12
These two rules, which follow directly from the superposition principle,
give a convenient method for determining final total states for any number of
observation processes in any combinations. We now seek the interpretation
of such final total states.
Let us consider the simple case of a single observation of a quantity A,
with eigenfunctions φi
, in the system S with initial state ψ
S
, by an observer
0 whose initial state is ψ
0
[··· ]
. The final result is, as we have seen, the superposition
ψ
0S+0 =
X
i
aiφiψ
0
[···αi]
. (18)
There is no longer any independent system state or observer state, although
the two have become correlated in a one-one manner. However, in each element of the superposition, φiψ
0
[···αi]
, the object-system state is a particular
eigenstate of the observation, and furthermore the observer-system state describes the observer as definitely perceiving that particular system state. This
correlation is what allows one to maintain the interpretation that a measurement has been performed.
We now consider a situation where the observer system comes into interaction with the object system for a second time. According to Rule 2 we
arrive at the total state after the second observation:
ψ
00S+0 =
X
i
aiφiψ
0
[···αi,αi]
. (19)
Again, each element φiψ
0
[···αi,αi]
describes a system eigenstate, but this time
also describes the observer as having obtained the same result for each of
the two observations. Thus for every separate state of the observer in the
final superposition the result of the observation was repeatable, even though
different for different states. The repeatability is a consequence of the fact
that after an observation the relative system state for a particular observer
state is the corresponding eigenstate.
Consider now a different situation. An observer-system 0, with initial
state ψ
0
[··· ]
, measures the same quantity A in a number of separate, identical,
systems which are initially in the same state, ψ
S1 = ψ
S2 = · · · = ψ
P
Sn =
i
aiφi (where the φi are, as usual, eigenfunctions of A). The initial total
state function is then

A typical element ψ

ij···k
of the final superposition describes a state of affairs wherein the observer has perceived an apparently random sequence of
definite results for the observations. Furthermore the object systems have
been left in the corresponding eigenstates of the observation. At this stage
suppose that a redetermination of an earlier system observation (Sl) takes
place. Then it follows that every element of the resulting final superposition will describe the observer with a memory configuration of the form
[α

i
, · · · α

j
, · · · α

] in which the earlier memory coincides with the later—
i.e., the memory states are correlated. It will thus appear to the observer,
as described by a typical element of the superposition, that each initial observation on a system caused the system to “jump” into an eigenstate in a
random fashion and thereafter remain there for subsequent measurements
14
on the same system. Therefore—disregarding for the moment quantitative
questions of relative frequencies—the probabilistic assertions of Process 1
appear to be valid to the observer described by a typical element of the final
superposition.
We thus arrive at the following picture: Throughout all of a sequence
of observation processes there is only one physical system representing the
observer, yet there is no single unique state of the observer (which follows
from the representations of interacting systems). Nevertheless, there is a
representation in terms of a superposition, each element of which contains
a definite observer state and a corresponding system state. Thus with each
succeeding observation (or interaction), the observer state “branches” into
a number of different states. Each branch represents a different outcome
of the measurement and the corresponding eigenstate for the object-system
state. All branches exist simultaneously in the superposition after any given
sequence of observations.‡
The “trajectory” of the memory configuration of an observer performing
a sequence of measurements is thus not a linear sequence of memory configurations, but a branching tree, with all possible outcomes existing simultaneously in a final superposition with various coefficients in the mathematical
‡Note added in proof.—In reply to a preprint of this article some correspondents have
raised the question of the “transition from possible to actual,” arguing that in “reality”
there is—as our experience testifies—no such splitting of observer states, so that only one
branch can ever actually exist. Since this point may occur to other readers the following
is offered in explanation.
The whole issue of the transition from “possible” to “actual” is taken care of in the
theory in a very simple way—there is no such transition, nor is such a transition necessary
for the theory to be in accord with our experience. From the viewpoint of the theory all
elements of a superposition (all “branches”) are “actual,” none any more “real” than the
rest. It is unnecessary to suppose that all but one are somehow destroyed, since all the
separate elements of a superposition individually obey the wave equation with complete
indifference to the presence or absence (“actuality” or not) of any other elements. This
total lack of effect of one branch on another also implies that no observer will ever be
aware of any “splitting” process.
Arguments that the world picture presented by this theory is contradicted by experience,
because we are unaware of any branching process, are like the criticism of the Copernican
theory that the mobility of the earth as a real physical fact is incompatible with the
common sense interpretation of nature because we feel no such motion. In both cases the
argument fails when it is shown that the theory itself predicts that our experience will be
what it in fact is. (In the Copernican case the addition of Newtonian physics was required
to be able to show that the earth’s inhabitants would be unaware of any motion of the
earth.)

model. In any familiar memory device the branching does not continue indefinitely, but must stop at a point limited by the capacity of the memory.
In order to establish quantitative results, we must put some sort of measure (weighting) on the elements of a final superposition. This is necessary
to be able to make assertions which hold for almost all of the observer states
described by elements of a superposition. We wish to make quantitative
statements about the relative frequencies of the different possible results of
observation—which are recorded in the memory—for a typical observer state;
but to accomplish this we must have a method for selecting a typical element
from a superposition of orthogonal states.
We therefore seek a general scheme to assign a measure to the elements of
a superposition of orthogonal states P
i
aiφi
. We require a positive function
m of the complex coefficients of the elements of the superposition, so that
m(ai) shall be the measure assigned to the element φi
. In order that this general scheme be unambiguous we must first require that the states themselves
always be normalized, so that we can distinguish the coefficients from the
states. However, we can still only determine the coefficients, in distinction to
the states, up to an arbitrary phase factor. In order to avoid ambiguities the
function m must therefore be a function of the amplitudes of the coefficients
alone, m(ai) = m(|ai
|).
We now impose an additivity requirement. We can regard a subset of the
superposition, say Pn
i=1 aiφi
, as a single element αφ0
:
αφ0 =
Xn
i=1
aiφi
. (25)
We the demand that the measure assigned to φ
0
shall be the sum of the
measures assigned to the φi (i from 1 to n):
m(α) = Xn
i=1
m(ai). (26)
Then we have already restricted the choice of m to the square amplitude
alone; in other words, we have m(ai) = a
∗
i ai
, apart from a multiplicative
constant.
To see this, note that the normality of φ
0
requires that |α| = (Pa
∗
i ai)
1
2 .
From our remarks about the dependence of m upon the amplitude alone, we
replace the ai by their amplitudes ui = |ai
|. Equation (26) then imposes the
16
requirement,
m(α) = m

Xm(ui) = Xm(u

2 . (27)
Defining a new function g(x)
g(x) = m(
√
x) (28)
we see that (27) requires that
g
Xu
2
i

=
Xg(u
2
i
). (29)
Thus g is restricted to be linear and necessarily has the form:
g(x) = cx (c constant). (30)
Therefore g(x
2
) = cx2 = m(
√
x
2
) = m(x) and we have deduced that m is
restricted to the form
m(ai) = m(ui) = cu2
i = ca∗
i ai
. (31)
We have thus shown that the only choice of measure consistent with our
additivity requirement is the square amplitude measure, apart from an arbitrary multiplicative constant which may be fixed, if desired, by normalization
requirements. (The requirement that the total measure be unity implies that
this constant is 1.)
The situation here is fully analogous to that of classical statistical mechanics, where one puts a measure on trajectories of systems in the phase
space by placing a measure on the phase space itself, and then making assertions (such as ergodicity, quasi-ergodicity, etc.) which hold for “almost
all” trajectories. This notion of “almost all” depends here also upon the
choice of measure, which is in this case taken to be the Lebesgue measure on
the phase space. One could contradict the statements of classical statistical
mechanics by choosing a measure for which only the exceptional trajectories
had nonzero measure. Nevertheless the choice of Lebesgue measure on the
phase space can be justified by the fact that it is the only choice for which
the “conservation of probability” holds, (Liouville’s theorem) and hence the
only choice which makes possible any reasonable statistical deductions at all.
In our case, we wish to make statements about “trajectories” of observers.
However, for us a trajectory is constantly branching (transforming from state
17
to superposition) with each successive measurement. To have a requirement
analogous to the “conservation of probability” in the classical case, we demand that the measure assigned to a trajectory at one time shall equal the
sum of the measures of its separate branches at a later time. This is precisely
the additivity requirement which we imposed and which leads uniquely to
the choice of square-amplitude measure. Our procedure is therefore quite as
justified as that of classical statistical mechanics.
Having deduced that there is a unique measure which will satisfy our requirements, the square-amplitude measure, we continue our deduction. This
measure then assigns to the i, j, · · · kth element of the superposition (24),

the measure (weight)

] is assigned the measure a

is a product measure, namely,
Mij···k = MiMj
· · · Mk (34)
where
Ml = a
∗
l al
so that the measure assigned to a particular memory sequence [α
1
i
, α2
j
, . . . , αr
k
]
is simply the product of the measures for the individual components of the
memory sequence.
There is a direct correspondence of our measure structure to the probability theory of random sequences. If we regard the Mij···k as probabilities
for the sequences then the sequences are equivalent to the random sequences
which are generated by ascribing to each term the independent probabilities
Ml = a
∗
l
al
. Now probability theory is equivalent to measure theory mathematically, so that we can make use of it, while keeping in mind that all
results should be translated back to measure theoretic language.
Thus, in particular, if we consider the sequences to become longer and
longer (more and more observations performed) each memory sequence of
the final superposition will satisfy any given criterion for a randomly generated sequence, generated by the independent probabilities a
∗
l
al
, except for a
18
set of total measure which tends toward zero as the number of observations
becomes unlimited. Hence all averages of functions over any memory sequence, including the special case of frequencies, can be computed from the
probabilities a
∗
i ai
, except for a set of memory sequences of measure zero. We
have therefore shown that the statistical assertions of Process 1 will appear
to be valid to the observer, in almost all elements of the superposition (24),
in the limit as the number of observations goes to infinity.
While we have so far considered only sequences of observations of the
same quantity upon identical systems, the result is equally true for arbitrary
sequences of observations, as may be verified by writing more general sequences of measurements, and applying Rules 1 and 2 in the same manner
as presented here.
We can therefore summarize the situation when the sequence of observations is arbitrary, when these observations are made upon the same or
different systems in any order, and when the number of observations of each
quantity in each system is very large, with the following result:
Except for a set of memory sequences of measure nearly zero,
the averages of any functions over a memory sequence can be calculated approximately by the use of the independent probabilities
given by Process 1 for each initial observation, on a system, and
by the use of the usual transition probabilities for succeeding observations upon the same system. In the limit, as the number of
all types of observations goes to infinity the calculation is exact,
and the exceptional set has measure zero.
This prescription for the calculation of averages over memory sequences
by probabilities assigned to individual elements is precisely that of the conventional “external observation” theory (Process 1). Moreover, these predictions hold for almost all memory sequences. Therefore all predictions of the
usual theory will appear to be valid to the observer in amost [sic] all observer
states.
In particular, the uncertainty principle is never violated since the latest
measurement upon a system supplies all possible information about the relative system state, so that there is no direct correlation between any earlier
results of observation on the system, and the succeeding observation. Any
observation of a quantity B, between two successive observations of quantity
A (all on the same system) will destroy the one-one correspondence between
the earlier and later memory states for the result of A. Thus for alternating
19
observations of different quantities there are fundamental limitations upon
the correlations between memory states for the same observed quantity, these
limitations expressing the content of the uncertainty principle.
As a final step one may investigate the consequences of allowing several
observer systems to interact with (observe) the same object system, as well
as to interact with one another (communicate). The latter interaction can be
treated simply as an interaction which correlates parts of the memory configuration of one observer with another. When these observer systems are
investigated, in the same manner as we have already presented in this section
using Rules 1 and 2, one finds that in all elements of the final superposition:
1. When several observers have separately observed the same quantity in
the object system and then communicated the results to one another they find
that they are in agreement. This agreement persists even when an observer
performs his observation after the result has been communicated to him by
another observer who has performed the observation.
2. Let one observer perform an observation of a quantity A in the object system, then let a second perform an observation of a quantity B in
this object system which does not commute with A, and finally let the first
observer repeat his observation of A. Then the memory system of the first
observer will not in general show the same result for both observations. The
intervening observation by the other observer of the non-commuting quantity B prevents the possibility of any one to one correlation between the two
observations of A.
3. Consider the case where the states of two object systems are correlated, but where the two systems do not interact. Let one observer perform
a specified observation on the first system, then let another observer perform
an observation on the second system, and finally let the first observer repeat
his observation. Then it is found that the first observer always gets the same
result both times, and the observation by the second observer has no effect
whatsoever on the outcome of the first’s observations. Fictitious paradoxes
like that of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen8 which are concerned with such
correlated, noninteracting systems are easily investigated and clarified in the
present scheme.
8Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, Phys. Rev. 47, 777 (1935). For a thorough discussion
of the physics of observation, see the chapter by N. Bohr in Albert Einstein, PhilosopherScientist (The Library of Living Philosophers, Inc., Evanston, 1949).
20
Many further combinations of several observers and systems can be studied within the present framework. The results of the present “relative state”
formalism agree with those of the conventional “external observation” formalism in all those cases where that familiar machinery is applicable.
In conclusion, the continuous evolution of the state function of a composite system with time gives a complete mathematical model for processes
that involve an idealized observer. When interaction occurs, the result of
the evolution in time is a superposition of states, each element of which assigns a different state to the memory of the observer. Judged by the state of
the memory in almost all of the observer states, the probabilistic conclusion
[sic] of the usual “external observation” formulation of quantum theory are
valid. In other words, pure Process 2 wave mechanics, without any initial
probability assertions, leads to all the probability concepts of the familiar
formalism.
6. Discussion
The theory based on pure wave mechanics is a conceptually simple, causal
theory, which gives predictions in accord with experience. It constitutes a
framework in which one can investigate in detail, mathematically, and in a
logically consistent manner a number of sometimes puzzling subjects, such
as the measuring process itself and the interrelationship of several observers.
Objections have been raised in the past to the conventional or “external
observation” formulation of quantum theory on the grounds that its probabilistic features are postulated in advance instead of being derived from the
theory itself. We believe that the present “relative-state” formulation meets
this objection, while retaining all of the content of the standard formulation.
While our theory ultimately justifies the use of the probabilistic interpretation as an aid to making practical predications, it forms a broader frame in
which to understand the consistency of that interpretation. In this respect
it can be said to form a metatheory for the standard theory. It transcends
the usual “external observation” formulation, however, in its ability to deal
logically with questions of imperfect observation and approximate measurement.
The “relative state” formulation will apply to all forms of quantum mechanics which maintain the superposition principle. It may therefore prove a
21
fruitful framework for the quantization of general relativity. The formalism
invites one to construct the formal theory first, and to supply the statistical
interpretation later. This method should be particularly useful for interpreting quantized unified field theories where there is no question of ever
isolating observers and object systems. They all are represented in a single
structure, the field. Any interpretative rules can probably only be deduced
in and through the theory itself.
Aside from any possible practical advantages of the theory, it remains
a matter of intellectual interest that the statistical assertions of the usual
interpretation do not have the status of independent hypotheses, but are
deducible (in the present sense) from the pure wave mechanics that starts
completely free of statistical postulates.
