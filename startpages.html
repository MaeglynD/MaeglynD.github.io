        <h1 class="title">Startpages</h1>
        <p class=" p-pad-bottom">A Startpage is the first page you see upon entering your browser.
           Chrome and Firefox both have a built in startpage, but neither are
           customizable to the user (Chrome themes can
           achieve individuality to some extent, but you still can't add
           your own shortcuts with ease). Startpages open many doors for
           showcasing new UI/UX themes as well as linking, deleting and
           storing most visited websites. Below are my top 3 favourite
           Startpages I’ve created (unsurprisingly, they’re also in date order).</p>
         <h2>1. Startpage Clean</h2>
         <img src="newAssets/startpageClean.png" alt="">
        <p class="p-pad-top p-pad-bottom">This startpage was originally inspired from a post I saw on /wg/
           and it's easily my favourite so far. It’s pretty much a testament
           to how drastically important font choices are when creating
           anything web based. The colors work unexpectedly well too, the
           intention behind them were obviously twitter equals blue, youtube
           equals red and so on. Assigning brand color to shortcuts opens
           up many doors to improvement. For example, we could code something
           that found the majority color of the brands logo and use that
           color as a background? Or when the user's adding in a new tab,
           perhaps it suggests to use said color? Either way functionality
           for adding new tabs in, purposely isn't added to the live site,
           but if i get around to it I may consider using local storage as
           a method of storing the users settings. Check it out here:

           <h2>2. Startpage Dream</h2>
           <img src="newAssets/startpageDream.png" alt="">
           <img src="newAssets/startpageDreamAdd.png" alt="">
           <p class="p-pad-top p-pad-bottom">Although second, it's still the start page I use today. The convenience
              of adding shortcuts on demand is great, but most of all I like the comfort
              this entire page gives off. Soft clouds, no in-your-face colors and all
              my personal links right there. What more can a man ask for when firing
              up his browser? It's still a WIP, but checkout the repo every now and
              again, 'great' things to come.<br>

          <h2>3. Startpage Kind</h2>
          <img src="newAssets/startpageKind.png" alt="">
          <p class="p-pad-top p-pad-bottom">One of my first startpages. It's pretty adorable, nothing groundbreaking
             and very easy to set up. The background is a looping 8bit art gif, meant
             to achieve the same atmosphere as startpage dream. If you like the look
             of it, feel free to check out the repo:
