          There have been countless studies over the course of history, attempting to find
          causal effects of happiness, many proving the significance of
          friends, family and love interests as a top priority for a happy
          life. Eighty years ago, <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/" target="_blank">
          Harvard began conducting what is now the
          longest happiness study in history</a>, in which they tracked the lives
          of several hundred young men from Boston's inner-city and are still
          collecting data to this day. A recurring theme of the study seems
          to be relationships and the colossal impact it has on our emotional wellbeing.
          This is to be expected, but surprisingly, those with strong relationships
          (with family, friends, etc.) were physically healthier compared to those who do not.
          Waldinger (the conductor of the experiment) noted;</p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>When we gathered
               together everything we knew about them about at age 50, it wasn’t their middle-age
               cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old, It was how satisfied
               they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships
               at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80.
          </p>

          Loneliness is also detrimental to a fulfilling life, due to the
          severe effects it can have on your personal growth. Growth and maturity pioneer how
          you handle the ups and downs of life, with no one to stand by you through rough
          times, negative thoughts will fester and perpetuate. This negativity will often create
          resentment towards family, leading to a vicious cycle of animosity towards yourself and others.

          With this information it's pretty clear how we can use our money to buy happiness. <span>On others.</span>
          And this doesn't just apply to family, businesses can adopt this to inject motivation in to
          the workplace too. <a href="http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/happiness-and-money/" target="_blank">This has been proven to work on sales teams</a>, whereby two different teams
          in a company are each (individually) given $15, one team is allowed to do whatever they please
          with it and the other is told to spend the $15 on their co-workers. The latter was shown to
          create 17x the return compared to the other team. Why? Perhaps strengthening the
          relationship between co-workers motivate them to make each other proud? It could also
          be that the co-workers feel happier and in turn are more motivated to work? Whatever the reason
          may be, its worked in multiple environments <a href="https://youtu.be/ZwGEQcFo9RE?t=9m54s" target="_blank">(including sports teams)</a> and gives us groundwork
          for our initial statement; Money can buy happiness.

              <p id="moneyBlgP">Prioritising connections over trivial things</p>
              <p>It seems obvious, but the majority of people don't live with it in mind (including myself).
               Getting swept up in the stress of a job or constantly fantasizing about the past is no way
               to live life. So back to the original question, ‘can money buy happiness’… Yea, but that's
               not to say being extremely wealthy will lead to extreme happiness. A poor person given a large
               sum of money will be happier as they’ll be relieved from the pressure of everyday life - having
               a place to live, taking care of the family, getting enough to eat and so on. Whereas, wealthy individuals that stumbleupon large
               financial gains aren't nearly as happy, if at all. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/08/27/1011492107" target="_blank">Studies on income level and happiness</a> have
               shown that the hypothetical ‘cap’ on emotional well-being and income, arrives at around the
               average income level ($75,000~).</p>
